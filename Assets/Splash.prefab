  splashes:
  - 'What about playing the og game '
  - Mario team or Luigi team?
  - Might be a funny game.
  - Might be hell.
  - Make it a toggle!
  - Nice ping.
  - Get stomped by air!
  - Mega incoming!
  - no gameplay toggles
  - already rejected
  - "it\u2019s not soda, so stop jumping into it"
  - "it\u2019s soda, jump into it"
  - Did ya bring a light?
  - "It\u2019s-a PERFECT!"
  - BAH! BAH!
  - "That\u2019s Mama Luigi to you, Mario!"
  - Where am I?
  - All toasters toast toast!
  - "I hope she made lots\u2019a spaghetti!"
  - Made by ipodtouch0218
  - Mod by HyperC@T
  - "Let\u2019s-a GO!"
  - WAHOO! ! !
  - Peaches, Peaches! Peaches, Peaches, Peaches!
  - "Also try Cubby\u2019s Character Mod!"
  - Also try HyperCat's Map Mod!
  - Also try Steve's Map Pack!
  - Also try Vic's Match-Inator!
  - Also try Toasted!
  - Also try Doodler's Mayhem! (when it releases)
  - Also try Vincells Battlefield Mod!
  - Also try HyperCat's Movie Maker!
  - Also try MiiBumm's Mega Item Mod! (when it releases)
  - Hello Mario. I'm Luigi.
  - "It\u2019s a stone, Luigi. You didn\u2019t make it."
  - Mamma mia!
  - Remember the Year of Luigi?
  - Welcome to the New Mushroom Kingdom!
  - Can be played on a microwave!
  - Do you yield?
  - You mean i wasted my tomato sauce?
  - The Thousand Year Ping!
  - "Where\u2019s \u201CIn the Final\u201D when you need it?"
  - "Where\u2019s \u201CThe Grand Finale\u201D when you need it?"
  - Zero Items, Final Destin. . .oh wait. Wrong game.
  - "The Mario Bros don\u2019t drain your bank account."
  - "Now you\u2019re playing with power!"
  - Now with more toggles!
  - Mushroom Kingdom, here we come!
  - Adding Sonic and/or Blaze from Sonic Rush Would add a bit of variety and uniqueness
    to the game and it would also be really cool if there was a toggleable option
    (host side) that enabled Sonic Rush Physics (players as sonic) with spindashing
    and such, as you can tell, I am a huge Sonic Fan and I would love it if you added
    this, though I'm not entirely sure how powerups would work... mabye fire dash
    powerup (fire shield but without the shield part) the bubble powerup (the one
    that let's you breathe lol but without the shield part) and the Invincibilty
    powerup and also a altered mega mushroom powerup that would make you bigger but
    not as big as the Mario one, but still quite big. And replacements for the ice
    flower and such I can't really think of ideas for so if anybody would like to
    help would be appreciated oh and also in water stages insert troll face here
    you. can. drown. I am horrible at C# so I have no idea how easy these will be
    to add but I know it may be mario forever so uhh yeaaaaaaaa............. lmao
    but uhhhhhhh pog oh and also the invincibility powerup should use silvagunners
    Sonic invincibility Mario remix (with permission of course) if permission is
    unobtainable try Sonic 3&K invincibility, here is a link to the Sonic Invincibility
    Mario thingy remix https://youtu.be/4NWiDUEnCYk and here is a link the Sonic
    3&K invincibility https://youtu.be/N6YqH9mKjv8 Oh and also forgot to mention
    that Mario's and Sonic's/Blaze can be in the same world just that Sonic/Blaze's
    Physics only apply to Sonic/Blaze Also my idea is probally quite unbalanced or
    something but if not pog, if it is then feel free to suggest ideas and balancing
    and stuf
